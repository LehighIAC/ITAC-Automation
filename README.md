# IAC-Automation

Automated Python script for Lehigh University Industrial Training and Assessment Center

This tutorial is designed for Mechanical Engineering people with zero programming knowledge.

## Required Software

Of course, you need to install Microsoft Office. https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/display/LKB/Windows+or+macOS%3A++Download+and+Install+Office+365

### Windows

Install [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

### macOS

Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh) then`brew install --cask visual-studio-code anaconda`

### Linux

LibreOffice compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Setting up Python environment

### Open Anaconda Prompt

```
conda create -n iac python=3.8
conda activate iac
```

### Install the Following Packages

```
conda install json5 numpy pandas openpyxl requests
conda install -c conda-forge python-docx docxcompose easydict latex2mathml num2words pgeocode
pip install python-docx-replace meteostat
```

`conda` always has the highest priority. If not available, install packages from `conda-forge`. Don't install from `pip` unless you have to, otherwise there might be dependency issue.

### Configure VS Code

Go to `Extensions`(Ctrl+Shift+X), install `Python` (from Microsoft) and `JSON5 syntax` (from mrmlnc).
Press Ctrl+Shift+P, search `Python: Select Interpreter` and select the `iac` environment you just created.

### NOTE: IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THIS ENVIRONMENT

```
conda remove --name iac --all
```

## Using templates

Is it suggested to work on a **copy** of this reposiotry when generating an IAC report.

For your convenience, download the main branch from this link: https://codeload.github.com/LehighIAC/IAC-Automation/zip/refs/heads/main , then use VS Code to open the **folder**.

### Energy Charts

1. Edit `Energy Charts.xlsx`. Select `fuel type` ,`fuel unit` and `start month`, then edit raw data (if copying from other spreadsheet, copy values only). The formatting is fully automatic and shouldn't be touched.
2. Save the workbook as `Web Page (.htm)` format in the same directory. DO NOT change the filename, all images will be kept in `Energy Charts.fld` folder. Currently this is the only stable way to save all charts as images.
3. Run `Utility.py` to extract energy usage data from the spreadsheet.

### Assessment Recommendations

1. Edit `.json5` database of any specific recommendation. Make sure the data type is matching the description.
2. Run the corresponding `.py` file. The output will be saved in `Recommendations` directory. Follow the instructions of the script if there's anything you need to adjust manually.

### Requirements of Manual Recommendation Files:

1. No requirement for filename, as long as it's `.docx`
2. Doesn't matter if the file is made from Python template, Excel template, or by hand. Please **break links** if you used Excel templates.
3. The title text should always be "Recommendation x: Title" or "Additional Recommendation x: Title". Case insensitive. In outline view the title should always be **Level 1**.
4. If there's any other type of energy savings, the unit should be `MMBtu`.
5. All subtitles, such as "Recommend Actions", "Anticipated Savings" should always be **body text** in outline view. Otherwise the automatic table of contents might be broken.
6. In rare cases, some .docx files are actually wrapped legacy .doc file (pre Word 2000) and is not supported by this tool. Please copy and paste everything to a new blank .docx file.

### Compiling Report

1. Fill required plant information in `Compiler.json5`.
2. Fill other gathered information in `Report/Description.docx`
3. Copy all recommendation documents(if you have any from other sources) into `Recommendations` directory.
4. Run `Compiler.py` to compile the final report.
5. Ctrl+A then F9 to refresh ToC, tables and figures, you need to do it **twice**.
